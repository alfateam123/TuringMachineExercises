#exercise 8 match 1

#how it works:
#it puts, at the end of tape, 
#a separator (x), returns to
#the first character of tape and
#begin the evaluation.
#the evaluation starts in state "first0" and
#continues in "first1".
#the number after "first" is a  flag
#checking it the automa can choose
#if it has to eliminate the character (without rewriting) or
#has to rewrite it at end of tape.
