This repository contains solutions to a great part of exercises proposed at the competition
of Turing Machines, hosted in Pisa by local university.

A lot of solutions are not commented or not understandable or not efficient, but they're only a possible solution: you can open a issue to ask about algorithm or reason about an implementative detail, or even to note me some bugs! Meanwhile, I'll comment them.
If you don't like a solution, fork this project to build your own algorithm and let me
know!

Repository has the following structure:

-algorithms
It contains a list of algorithms that can be used in every problem you need them.
They are designed to be understandable, easily customizable and quite fast (accordingly to tape length and others parameters).
Even here, if you have a better idea, let me know!

-solutions
It contains a list of folders, that are referred to editions of the competition.
The folder matchXX has some solutions, exYY, that solves the problem YY proposed in the XX edition of the competition.
You can see text of the exercises (in Italian, I'll write the translation into the solution file) at http://mdt.di.unipi.it/TestiGara/ and go to XXth item.

Solutions are designed to run into the Turing Machine Simulator developed by Information Tecnology Department at Pisa University. You can try it at http://mdt.di.unipi.it/TMSimulatore/TMApplet.html

Syntax:
Please note that uses this syntax:
(actual_state, read_char, next_state, written_char, direction).
